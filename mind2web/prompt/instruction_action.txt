Given a software development agent task trajectory, your task is to extract the common workflows to solve this task.
Each given task contains a series of actions to solve the task. You need to find a repetitive subset of actions in the task that can be applied to other tasks, and extract each of them out as a workflow.
Each workflow should be a commonly-reused sub-routine of the tasks. Do not generate similar or overlapping workflows. Each workflow should have at least two steps.
Please output the workflows and nothing else.

For example, here are some workflows that would be applied to web navigation tasks. When generating workflows, please follow a similar format.
